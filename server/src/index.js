/**
 * Every GraphQL resolver function actually receives four input arguments: parent, args, contextValue, info
 * The first argument, commonly called parent (or sometimes root) is the result of the previous resolver execution level.
 *
 * The query:
 * query {
 *  feed {
 *      id
 *      url
 *      description
 *  }
 * }
 * has two of these execution levels.
 *
 * On the first level, it invokes the feed resolver and returns the entire data stored in links.
 * For the second execution level, the GraphQL server invokes the resolvers of the Link type
 * (because thanks to the schema, it knows that feed returns a list of Link elements)
 * for each element inside the list that was returned on the previous resolver level.
 *
 * Therefore, in all of the three Link resolvers, the incoming parent object is the element inside the links list.
